## Description
In this app we took starter code from a previous activity that we completed. Then, we refactored it to use Redux to manage global state instead of React's built in context.

## Technologies
- React
- Node.js
- Redux
- Apollo/GraphQL
- MongoDB / Mongoose
## Usage
To test this website, you can either fork the repository and clone it or go straight to the deployed link on heroku.

### Deployement
Visit the deployed app at: https://mheer-redux-store.herokuapp.com/

### Fork a Repository
Fork this repository and clone the forked repo. Once cloned, run `npm i`. Once you install all of the packages, run `npm run seed` to seed the database. This app uses mongodb so make sure you have mongo installed before seeding. After you seed, run `npm run develop` and the app should auto launch in the browser. At this point, the app functions like any other e-commerce store.
